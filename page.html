        <h2>A little more about me</h2>
        <div>
          <p> Everything in my life seem to circle around tree main passions, Technology, nature and people.
             <br>So far in my proffitional life, the people have held the main spotligt.
          </p>
          <p>
            First combined with technology, where I was a certified event coordinator, ran a small department hosting a multitude of events centred around teaching game development.<br> 

            Then combined with nature, where I was a professional ski instructor at <a href="https://www.sunpeaksresort.com/"> Sun Peaks, Canada BC,</a> both thought skiing and hosted and executes weekly events on the mountain.<br>
            
            Now my focus has shifted to technology, where I'm currently enrolled as a software engineering student at <a href="https://bachelor.au.dk/softwareteknologi">Aarhus University</a>

            GIT, an intro! 
          </h2>
          <p>
            I have volunteered to create a small git work shop for my semester. 
            Here is the matiral for that! 
            
            
            
            
            This post makes the first iteration of my first website! Really existing stuff. <br>
           Not that the technology I have used is very interesting, as the front page stated. <br>
           The website is a single HTML file, with a little CSS, that I did not write. <br>
 
           But I'm exited that I now have a place to share things I create and achieved!
 
           The road stated with an <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/"> Udemy Course</a>, were completed the HTML part. Then half a year later, a random <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">hacker news</a> post<label for="fn1">1</label><input type="checkbox" id="fn1">
           <small> <!-- footnote one! -->
             I sadly can't find the <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com">hacker news</a> post any more…
           </small>
           Finally, paved the way for getting content on my domain, that has been sitting idle since probably 2017!
 
           <img src="page_files/under_construction.png" alt="screenshot of the under construction website previously hosted on mbirk.dk"/>

              I attended a high school called <a href="https://videndjurs.dk/game-college"><a href="https://videndjurs.dk/game-college">Game College</a></a>  that teaches Game Developing on top of the normal <a href="https://www.denmarkeducation.info/tests/k-12-tests/higher-technical-examination-for-danish-upper-secondary-or-high-school-students.html"> technical high school</a> curriculum, though multiple projects each year. <br>
             Our graduation project was the game Solar Sailors, my primary responsibility was aligning the team with the process, and making sure we meet our requirements and deadlines. <br>
             The Project spanned 3 mounts, and the Team consists of 6 programmers, 3 artists and me as the primary producer. <br>
             The goal was to create a fun and engaging game where the players had to work together to win. <br>
